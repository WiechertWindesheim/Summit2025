# Summit2025 LAB3: Support energy transition utilising BIM and parametric modelling in a BPES context
Description of LAB3

## KLO 1 Fundamentals of building performance and energy simulation with BIM-based data modelling and exchange requirements
Part 1: College - Information Delivery Specifications, Building Smart.
Part 2: Exercise - Putting information into properties.

## KLO 2 The exchange gap, insight in exchanging data
Explaining the exchange gap Viewing diverse energy calculation software Possibilities to exchange data from a model to energy calculation software.

## KLO 3 Modelling training
Using BIMsoftware to make models for energycalculation.
Modelling a simple building (exercise).
Extracting data from the model.

## Software requirements and download links
In KLO 1 part 2 we use modelling software like Revit and ArchiCad. So prepare that you have a licence, for instance a educational version.
It is allowed to use your own modelling software, but it must have the possibility to export data in IFC-format.
In KLO 3 we use Blender. Here is the link: https://docs.bonsaibim.org/quickstart/installation.html
