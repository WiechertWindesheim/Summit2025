# Summit2025 LAB3: Support energy transition utilising BIM and parametric modelling in a BPES context
Description of LAB3

## KLO 1 Fundamentals of building performance and energy simulation with BIM-based data modelling and exchange requirements
Part 1: College - Information Delivery Specifications, Building Smart.
Part 2: Exercise - Putting information into properties.

## KLO 2 The exchange gap, insight in exchanging data
Explaining the exchange gap Viewing diverse energy calculation software Possibilities to exchange data from a model to energy calculation software.

## KLO 3 Modelling training
Using BIMsoftware to make models for energycalculation.
Modelling a simple building (exercise).
Extracting data from the model.

## Software requirements and download links
During the excercises we use Revit and ArchiCad as modelling software.
So be sure that one of these softwarepackages is installed at your computer. 
You can get educational licenses at Autodesk (Revit) or Graphisoft (ArchiCad).

It is allowed to bring your own modelling software as long as it is able to export the models in IFC-format.

For the use of the data in calculation software we use Blender with the Bonsai-plugin.
